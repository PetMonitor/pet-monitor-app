    Suggested node version 16.13.2

## To test in an ioS simulator:

    - A computer with ioS operating system.
    - XCode App.

## To test in Android simulator:

    - Android Studio with required dependencies for emulator.

## To test this in a mobile device

# Locally run the application

In the root directory of this project run:

    - npm start

The browser will open in Metro Bundler, and from here you can chose to: - Attach the app to a simulator, - Scan the QR code using the Expo client app in your phone, to test it there. - Publish the application to a unique URL accessible from any phone with Expo Client.

## Debug the application

Run the application and open developer console in the emulator:

### Debug in VSCode

    - Install React Native Tools extension and in the .vscode folder, create a file launch.json that contains:

        {
            "version":"0.2.0",
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name":"Attach to packager",
                    "request":"attach",
                    "type":"reactnative",
                    "cwd":"${workspaceFolder}"
                }
            ]
        }

    - Open the app in a simulator.
    - The packager port must be the one used by Metro Bundler. Copy that port and set the port by going to:
       1) Code > Preferences > Settings (in vscode)
       2) Search for react-native.packager.port in Settings' User tab.
       3) Change the port value to the one Metro Bundler is running.
    - Close the web browser where Metro Bundler is running.
    - Go to VSCode debug panel and select 'Attach to packager' in RUN options.
    - Set the desired breakpoints in VSCode.
    - In the app simulator open the developer console (Cmd + D) and hit Reload.
    - After you're done debugging remember to disconnect the debugger.

### Troubleshooting

- If icons show up as question marks:
  > npm install -g react-native-cli
  > react-native link react-native-vector-icons

- Getting error `fontFamily "material-community" is not a system font and has not been loaded through Font.loadAsync.`
  > rm -rf ./node_modules/expo/node_modules/expo-font/
